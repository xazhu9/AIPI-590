        "Through perturbation analysis of the prompt's symbols, patterns, and text, we observe distinct shifts in the model's response in terms of emotional tone, structure, and expressiveness. Symbol perturbations (like replacing exclamation marks with periods or question marks) show that punctuation significantly impacts the emotional weight of responses: exclamation marks and question marks tend to evoke responses with heightened sentiment and reverence, while periods yield more neutral, composed answers. (An interesting part is that only with the question mark in the first sentence, the model somtimes will include the discussion about the last game in the response.)\n",

        "In pattern perturbations, adding repetition or guided phrasing encouraged the model to generate responses with greater depth and logical progression, often exploring multiple facets of Kobe’s potential legacy. Paticularly, when using the guided phrasing, model's response is more logical and clear, with step by step discussion.\n",
